## 1. Introduction

### Project Introduction

This project focuses on the comprehensive design and analysis of a CMOS inverter using the SKY130 PDK. The design process begins with schematic creation and circuit simulation, employing Xschem for schematic capture and Ngspice for detailed simulation. The layout design of the inverter is then performed using Magic VLSI, ensuring that the physical layout adheres to design rules and matches the schematic.

To validate the design, a behavioral description of the CMOS inverter is created using Verilog code, which is then simulated using Icarus Verilog. The RTL synthesis of the Verilog code is carried out using Yosys, providing a gate-level representation of the design. Layout versus Schematic (LVS) verification is performed using Netgen to ensure that the physical layout accurately represents the schematic design.

The project includes thorough analysis of Voltage Transfer Characteristics (VTC), power consumption, propagation delay, and noise margins to ensure optimal performance and reliability of the inverter. Additionally, the design process involves creating visual representations of the netlist using NetlistSVG and generating RTL netlists with GraphViz to facilitate better understanding chip design flow.

## 3. Schematic Analysis

### 3.1 Schematic Circuit 

![Inverter Circuit](assets/images/schematic_circuit/inv_circuit.png)

An inverter was designed in Xschem using components from the SKY130 PDK, specifically pfet_01v8 and nfet_01v8. The inputs ("in", "vdd", and "gnd") were connected using ipin.sym, while the output ("out") was connected with opin.sym. After constructing the circuit, a symbol was created using the Xschem symbol creation feature (Press A). The inverter symbol was then refined using the polygon tool to accurately represent the inputs and outputs.Following this, a testbench for the inverter was developed to facilitate further analysis. This setup ensures that the schematic captures all necessary connections and parameters required for accurate simulation and testing of the inverter’s performance in subsequent stages.


![Inverter Default Symbol](assets/images/schematic_circuit/inv_default_sym.png)


![Inverter Symbol](assets/images/schematic_circuit/inv_symbol.png)



### 3.2 Voltage Transfer Characteristics

![Test Bench](assets/images/vtc/inv_vtc_tb.png)

A .dc analysis was performed using Ngspice to plot the input voltage (vin) against the output voltage (vout), focusing on determining the tripping point (Vm) of the inverter. Initially, the W/L ratio was set to 2, and the Vm was found to be 0.869V, slightly less than the desired 0.9V.Increasing the size to 4 achieved a Vm of 0.905V, indicating a more accurate tripping point but at the cost of larger area consumption in the chipset. Consequently, a size of 2 was chosen, balancing accuracy and area efficiency.

![VTC Graph](assets/images/vtc/vtc_graph.png)

![Size Rato 2](assets/images/vtc/inv_vtc_size2.png)

This tripping point is critical as it defines the transition between logic 0 and logic 1, adhering to the thumb rule where Vm should be approximately half of Vdd. The analysis underscores the importance of optimizing the inverter's design to achieve a precise Vm, which is essential for reliable logic level determination in digital circuits.

![Size Rato 4](assets/images/vtc/inv_vtc_size4.png)



### 3.3 Noise Analysis


![Noise Analysis](assets/images/noise_analysis/noise_analysis_comments.png)

Noise analysis is essential to understand the inverter's behavior in the presence of unwanted signals. MOSFETs amplify noise due to their transconductance (gm) and output resistance (Ro). The gain range over which the noise is amplified was identified.For the inverter, the input voltage range considered as logic 0 (VIL) was up to 0.7435V, and the range for logic 1 (VIH) was after 0.980V. Corresponding output voltages were 1.748V (VOH) for VIL and 0.6747V (VOL) for VIH. 

![Gain Region](assets/images/noise_analysis/noise_gain_region.png)

This analysis ensures that transitions avoid noise amplification regions, maintaining signal integrity. By identifying these noise margins, the design can be optimized to minimize susceptibility to noise, which is crucial for the stability and reliability of high-speed digital circuits.

![Gain with Vout](assets/images/noise_analysis/noise_gain_range_with_vout.png)



### 3.4 Delay Analysis

![Delay Analysis](assets/images/delay_analysis/delay_calculation.png)

Propagation delays were measured to evaluate the inverter's response time. The high-to-low propagation delay (tpHL) was 0.254 ps, and the low-to-high propagation delay (tpLH) was 0.398 ps, calculated from the time the input reaches 50% to the output reaching 50% of its final value.Additionally, the rise time (tr) was 0.634 ps, and the fall time (tf) was 0.512 ps. These metrics are crucial for understanding the speed performance of the inverter in digital circuits. Accurate delay analysis ensures that the inverter can operate effectively within the timing constraints of complex VLSI systems, thereby enhancing overall circuit performance.

![Delay Vout](assets/images/delay_analysis/delay_vout.png)

### 3.5 Power Analysis

![Power Calculation](assets/images/power_analysis/avg_power_cal.png)

Power consumption of the inverter was analyzed over a single cycle, focusing on the second cycle. By plotting Vdd#branch in Ngspice, the current was measured, and the average power was calculated using the formula:

![Power Formula](assets/images/power_analysis/formula.png)

where \( T \) is the time period, \( id \) is the current flow, and \( Vdd \) is the supply voltage.

![Id](assets/images/power_analysis/power_id.png)

 The measured average power was 0.814 µW. This power analysis is critical for designing energy-efficient circuits, which is particularly important in battery-powered and portable devices. By optimizing power consumption, the overall efficiency and longevity of the electronic system can be significantly improved.

## 5. Behavioural Description

### 5.1 Verilog Inverter Design

![Inverter Behavioural Design](assets/images/verilog/verilog_code_tb.png)

For larger circuit designs, breaking down the design into smaller, manageable blocks is essential. A behavioral description of the inverter was created using Verilog for logic synthesis. The design was verified using a testbench file in Icarus Verilog and visualized with GTKWave to ensure correct functionality. This step is crucial for verifying that the design behaves as intended before proceeding to more complex synthesis stages.

## 6. RTL Logic Synthesis

### 6.1 Yosys Synthesis

#### Yosys Commands


Yosys, a free and powerful synthesis tool, was used for logic synthesis of the Verilog code. Yosys converts the behavioral Verilog description into a gate-level netlist, facilitating verification and analysis of the Finite State Machine (FSM) and overall circuit synthesis. The synthesis process includes generating a NetlistSVG with JSON and visualizing the logic synthesis with GraphViz. Commands for these operations are executed in the Yosys terminal. The resulting JSON can be rendered using an appropriate online tool, while the .dot file can be viewed with the xdot command in the terminal.

```
$ read_verilog inverter.v
$ hierarchy -check -top inverter
$ read_verilog -lib cmos_cells.lib
$ synth
$ dfflibmap -liberty cmos_cells.lib
$ opt_clean
$ write_verilog synth.v
$ help write_json
$ write_json synth.json
```
##### Continue with Above Commands for GraphViz :
```
$ help show
$ show -prefix synth -notitle -colors 2 -width -format dot
```
##### Open synth.dot in Directory
```
$ xdot synth.dot &
```
To get Gate level synthesis using JSON, we can install [NetlistSVG](https://github.com/nturley/netlistsvg) to convert the synth.json file into NetlistSVG Gate level synthesis. Another way, we can directly convert the .json file through this [Website](https://neilturley.dev/netlistsvg/).
