#### In this project, we developed an 8-bit Carry Select Adder (CSA) following a complete design flow. We began with the schematic design using Xschem and validated it with Ngspice simulations. The behavioral design was implemented in Verilog and synthesized to the gate level using Yosys. The layout was created in Magic VLSI, and Layout Versus Schematic (LVS) validation was performed using Netgen. This project demonstrates the full CSA design process, from schematic and behavioral design to physical implementation and verification.

  ## 1. Introduction

  In this project, we designed an 8-bit Carry Select Adder (CSA) following a comprehensive VLSI design flow. A Carry Select Adder is an efficient adder design used in digital circuits to speed up the process of addition by calculating multiple carries in parallel. It reduces the delay by independently calculating the sum and carry for different possible carry inputs and then selecting the correct output using multiplexers. We began our project with the schematic design using Xschem and performed simulations using Ngspice to validate the functionality of the circuit at the transistor level. The behavioral design was implemented using Verilog, and we synthesized the gate-level netlist using Yosys, an open-source synthesis tool.
  
  For layout design, we utilized Magic VLSI to create the physical layout, ensuring design rules and performance criteria were met. Layout versus schematic (LVS) validation was conducted using Netgen to confirm that the layout accurately represents the schematic design. Throughout the project, we employed the open-source SKY130 Process Design Kit (PDK) to leverage industry-standard technology in an accessible manner. Each step of the process, from schematic capture and simulation to synthesis, layout, and validation, was meticulously executed and documented, demonstrating a complete design flow of a CSA using state-of-the-art open-source tools.
