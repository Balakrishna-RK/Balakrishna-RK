  ## 1. Introduction
The design of an 8-bit Carry Select Adder (CSA) followed a comprehensive VLSI design flow. The Carry Select Adder, known for its efficiency in digital circuits, speeds up addition by calculating multiple carries in parallel. It reduces delay by independently computing the sum and carry for different carry inputs and selecting the correct output using multiplexers. The project began with schematic design using Xschem, with simulations performed using Ngspice to validate transistor-level functionality. Behavioral design was implemented in Verilog, and the gate-level netlist was synthesized using Yosys, an open-source synthesis tool.

For layout design, Magic VLSI was utilized to create the physical layout, ensuring compliance with design rules and performance criteria. Layout versus Schematic (LVS) validation was conducted using Yosys to confirm accurate representation of the schematic design. The open-source SKY130 Process Design Kit (PDK) was employed throughout the project to leverage industry-standard technology. Each step of the process, from schematic capture and simulation to synthesis, layout, and validation, was meticulously executed and documented, showcasing a complete CSA design flow using state-of-the-art open-source tools.

## 3. RTL Design

### 3.1 CSA HDL Description

A Carry Select Adder (CSA) accelerates the addition process by dividing it into smaller blocks, enabling parallel computation. The 8-bit CSA consists of a lower block and an upper block, each responsible for computing 4-bit operations. The lower block processes the least significant 4 bits without needing separate carry inputs of 0 and 1. The CSA utilizes ripple carry adders and multiplexers. The LSB block operates as a standard Ripple Carry Adder. The MSB block performs two parallel computations: one with the carry input set to 0 and the other with the carry input set to 1. When a carry is generated in the LSB block, the multiplexer selects the appropriate carry-out value based on this input.

## 5. Full Adder Schematic and Layout Design

### 5.1 FA Schematic Design

  The Full adder is designed using the generate, propagate, and delete methodology with CMOS logic. This design and implementation will be carried out using the SkyWater 130nm technology, employing Xschem and Ngspice software. A full adder is a digital circuit that adds three input bits (A, B, and Cin) and produces two output bits (SUM and CARRY). The full adder performs binary addition, where the SUM output represents the sum of the three inputs, and the CARRY output represents the carry-over bit from the addition.
![FA Schematic Circuit](assets/images/full_adder/schematic/full_adder.svg)

![FA symbol](assets/images/full_adder/schematic/fa_symbol.png)

In CMOS technology, the full adder design typically involves using complementary pairs of p-type and n-type MOSFETs (PMOS and NMOS) to achieve low power consumption and high-speed operation. The generate, propagate, and delete logic can be implemented using standard CMOS gates to ensure robustness and efficiency.
  
 ![FA testbench](assets/images/full_adder/schematic/fa_testbench.png)

The full adder schematic is created in Xschem and saved as [full_adder.sch](assets/files/schematic/full_adder.sch) . A corresponding [symbol](assets/files/schematic/full_adder.sym) is generated to facilitate its integration into the Carry Select Adder (CSA) module. The [test bench](assets/files/schematic/fa_tb.sch) for the full adder is simulated using Ngspice, verifying the functionality of the design through circuit waveforms. The use of symmetric sizes for both NMOS and PMOS transistors ensures balanced performance and minimal signal distortion.

![FA Schematic Output](assets/images/full_adder/schematic/fa_schematic_output.png)

### 5.2 FA Layout Design
![FA Layout Design](assets/images/full_adder/layout/fa_magic_layout.png)
  The layout for the full adder is designed as a [full_adder.mag](assets/files/full_adder_layout/full_adder.mag) module and implemented in the CSA module using the SkyWater 130nm Process Design Kit (PDK). During layout design, it is crucial to maintain a symmetric width-to-length (W/L) ratio for the transistors to ensure consistent performance. The area of each gate is optimized according to design specifications to achieve a compact and efficient layout.

![FA Layout Spice file](assets/images/full_adder/layout/fa_spice.png)

The layout is extracted to a .ext file using the "extract all" command, and the .ext file is converted to a [SPICE file](assets/files/full_adder_layout/full_adder.spice) using the ext2spice command for LVS (Layout Versus Schematic) verification.

### 5.3 FA Layout Versus Schematic

The SPICE file obtained from the layout design in Magic VLSI is used to perform LVS verification. LVS validation involves comparing the extracted layout netlist with the original schematic netlist to ensure that the physical layout accurately represents the intended circuit design. This process checks for any discrepancies in connectivity, component values, and overall circuit functionality. The [SPICE code](assets/files/full_adder_layout/fa_ngspice.spice) for LVS testing includes the necessary inputs to simulate the layout and verify that the outputs match those of the schematic design. This thorough validation ensures that the full adder design is both logically and physically consistent, meeting all design requirements and performance criteria.

## 6. CSA Schematic and Layout Design

### 6.1 CSA Schematic Design

  Using the full adder and 2-to-1 multiplexer symbols created in Xschem, an [8-Bit Carry Select Adder](assets/files/schematic/carry_select_adder.sch)(CSA) is designed. The carry select adder works by dividing the addition process into smaller groups, each of which computes two potential sums: one assuming a carry-in of zero and the other assuming a carry-in of one.
  
#### Average Power:
![Average Power calculation](assets/images/csa/schematic/power_analysis.png)

  These sums are then selected based on the actual carry-in, resulting in faster addition by parallelizing the carry propagation. After designing the CSA in Xschem, a SPICE netlist is generated and simulated using Ngspice to verify the output. The simulation results indicate that the average power consumption over 80 ns is 0.9179 µW.

### 6.2 CSA Layout Design

  The [Layout design](assets/files/csa_layout/carry_select_adder.mag) of the 8-bit CSA is performed in Magic VLSI, utilizing previously designed full adder and 2-to-1 multiplexer layouts. Technical parameters such as metal layers, transistor dimensions, and parasitic elements are carefully considered during the design process. The getcell <name> command is used to import the required modules into the layout, and the layout is extended using the "x" command. To modify the layout, the load <cell path/cell name> command is executed in the tkcon window. After modifications, the layout is saved and reloaded. The commands extract all and ext2spice are used to generate the [.spice](assets/files/csa_layout/carry_select_adder.spice) file for layout versus schematic (LVS) validation.

![CSA Layout](assets/images/csa/layout/csa_magic_layout.png)

### 6.3 CSA Layout Versus Schematic
  Layout versus Schematic (LVS) is a crucial verification step in VLSI design, ensuring that the physical layout matches the schematic at the netlist level. Using the .spice file obtained from the CSA layout design, simulations are conducted by writing the corresponding [SPICE code](assets/files/csa_layout/csa_ngspice.spice) and applying valid inputs to verify the output. The ongoing LVS of the CSA is being worked on, and updates will be provided in the repository once the verification is complete.
