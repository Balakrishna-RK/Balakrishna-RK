## 1. Introduction
  The project involves the schematic design and analysis of an 8-bit, 8-word Static RAM (SRAM) using Xschem integrated with the SKY130 Process Design Kit (PDK) and simulated using Ngspice. Gate-level synthesis is achieved using Yosys. SRAM is a type of volatile memory that uses bistable latching circuitry to store each bit, providing fast access and low power consumption. The 6T SRAM cell, the fundamental building block of this SRAM, consists of six transistors: two cross-coupled inverters forming a bistable latch and two access transistors connecting the latch to the bitlines.

  
  Data is written or read by selecting the appropriate cell using a row decoder, which connects to the Wordline (WL) of the 6T SRAM cell, and a column decoder, which connects to the Bitline (BL) and Bitline Bar (BLB). The row decoder activates the WL to select a row of cells, while the column decoder selects the bitlines to read or write data. This design ensures efficient memory access and reliable data storage, with the decoders facilitating precise selection and manipulation of individual cells within the array.

## 4. 6T SRAM CELL Design
A 6T SRAM cell consists of six transistors: two PMOS (M4 and M2), two NMOS (M3 and M1), and two additional NMOS (M5 and M6) that connect to the bitlines. The PMOS transistors (M4 and M2) have a larger W/L ratio compared to the bitline NMOS transistors (M5 and M6), and the NMOS transistors (M3 and M1) are also sized larger than M5 and M6. This sizing strategy ensures that the cell can hold its state reliably during read and write operations. When one bitline is driven high, the corresponding bitline bar is pulled low, causing one of the cross-coupled inverters' outputs to be high and the other to be low. This differential signal between the bitlines reinforces the latched state of the inverters, maintaining the stored bit. The larger transistors (M3 and M1) enhance the drive strength for maintaining the stored value, while the bitline NMOS transistors (M5 and M6) facilitate the read and write access by connecting the cell to the bitlines during these operations.

### Write Operation
For a 6T SRAM cell write operation:

- Drive one bitline high and the other low.
- Turn on the wordline.
- Bitlines overpower the cell with the new value.
- Writability:
  - Must overpower the feedback inverter (M5 >> M4).

This behavior ensures that the new data is successfully written into the 6T SRAM cell by leveraging the stronger bitline transistors (M5 and M6) to overpower the feedback from the cell's cross-coupled inverters (M1-M4).

### Read Operation
For a 6T SRAM cell read operation:

- Precharge both bitlines high.
- Turn on the wordline.
- One of the two bitlines will be pulled down by the cell.
- Read stability:
  - The stored value (Q) must not flip.
  - The pull-down NMOS transistor (M3) must be stronger than the access NMOS transistor (M5) (M3 >> M5).

This behavior ensures that the stored data is read correctly without altering the state of the 6T SRAM cell, maintaining its stability during the read operation.
