The project involves the schematic design and analysis of an 8-bit 8-word Static RAM (SRAM) using Xschem, integrated with the SkyWater 130nm Process Design Kit (SKY130PDK), and simulated using Ngspice. SRAM is a type of semiconductor memory that uses bistable latching circuitry to store each bit. Unlike dynamic RAM (DRAM), SRAM does not need to be periodically refreshed, making it faster but also more expensive. This SRAM design consists of 8 words, each 8 bits in size, organized to allow for efficient data storage and retrieval.

The design process begins with the creation of the SRAM schematic in Xschem, leveraging the components and models provided by the SKY130PDK. Following the schematic design, the circuit is simulated using Ngspice to validate its functionality and performance. The next step involves gate-level synthesis, performed using Yosys, to translate the high-level schematic into a netlist suitable for layout and fabrication.

Through this project, a comprehensive understanding of SRAM architecture and its implementation in a modern semiconductor process is achieved, demonstrating key skills in VLSI design flow from schematic capture to synthesis.
